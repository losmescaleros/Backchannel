=== Other Notes
* Signed in users may propose categories, which are to be approved by an administrator.
Administrators may choose to deny a proposal, which essentially is deleting the
category from the list of categories.
* The search bar, links to posts and categories, and user management links are all
included in the layout's navigation bar. You may choose to refine your search
by selecting a search criteria option from the dropdown list beside the search
form.
* When using the search bar, searching by category looks for an exact match of the category
name. If you wish, you may also view all categories and view posts associated with that specific
category.
